# STPSR
We propose a structure and texture preserving network (STPSR) for real-world image super-resolution, which extracts both structural information and local textures.


    
## Qualitative Results
### On real-world datasets
We compare our method with several state-of-the-art methods. The examples are from real-world datasets DPED, OST300, and ADE20K validation. Arrows indicate where the difference is best reflected.

### On synthetic datasets
Visual results between Real-ESRGAN and our method. The examples are from datasets BSD100, Urban100, and DIV2K validation. The scale factor is x4.
